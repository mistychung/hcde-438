    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p id="first-para">
      This is the introductory text and is designed to be boring. But at least
      it is not in Latin. Have you seen text that goes "<span class="latintext"
        >Lorem ipsum...</span
      >"?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have ever wondered what that is about, Wikipedia has a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">nice article</a> on
      <span class="latintext">Lorem ipsum</span>.
